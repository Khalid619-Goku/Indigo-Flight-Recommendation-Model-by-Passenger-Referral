# **Project Name**    -
#Classification - IndiGo Airline Passenger Referral Prediction

# **Project Summary -**

In the dynamic and highly competitive airline industry, companies like IndiGo are continuously striving to enhance customer experience and build lasting loyalty. A critical component of this effort is understanding and predicting passenger referrals, which can significantly influence the airline's market position and reputation. The analysis of passenger reviews from 2006 to 2019 offers IndiGo a comprehensive view into the various facets of the travel experience as perceived by their customers. These reviews provide invaluable feedback on service quality, including comfort, service, and overall value, and play a key role in shaping potential customers' perceptions.


By leveraging this extensive dataset, IndiGo aims to develop a predictive model to identify which passengers are most likely to recommend the airline to others. This insight enables IndiGo to:

1. Enhance Customer Experience:

By pinpointing the factors that most influence positive referrals, IndiGo can focus on improving these aspects of their service, ensuring that they meet or exceed customer expectations.

2. Targeted Improvements:

The ability to predict referrals allows IndiGo to address specific areas needing improvement, whether it be in-flight comfort, customer service, or overall value for money.

3. Strategic Marketing:

Understanding referral patterns can help IndiGo tailor their marketing strategies to leverage positive word-of-mouth and foster a strong brand reputation.

4. Competitive Edge:

By continuously refining their services based on customer feedback, IndiGo can differentiate itself from competitors and strengthen its position in the market.

# **Problem Statement**

Problem Statement:

IndiGo Airlines aims to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty by understanding the factors that drive positive passenger referrals. By leveraging a dataset of passenger reviews from 2006 to 2019, the objective is to develop a predictive model that identifies passengers most likely to recommend the airline. This will enable IndiGo to pinpoint areas for service improvement, tailor marketing strategies, and ultimately gain a competitive edge in the market.

Explanation:

This problem statement highlights:

The Business Goal: Enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.
The Specific Problem: Lack of understanding of factors driving passenger referrals.
The Approach: Building a predictive model using passenger reviews.
The Expected Outcome: Identification of passengers likely to recommend IndiGo and actionable insights for service improvements and marketing strategies.

# **General Guidelines** : -

1.   Well-structured, formatted, and commented code is required.
2.   Exception Handling, Production Grade Code & Deployment Ready Code will be a plus. Those students will be awarded some additional credits.
     
     The additional credits will have advantages over other students during Star Student selection.
       
             [ Note: - Deployment Ready Code is defined as, the whole .ipynb notebook should be executable in one go
                       without a single error logged. ]

3.   Each and every logic should have proper comments.
4. You may add as many number of charts you want. Make Sure for each and every chart the following format should be answered.
        

```
# Chart visualization code
```
            

*   Why did you pick the specific chart?
*   What is/are the insight(s) found from the chart?
* Will the gained insights help creating a positive business impact?
Are there any insights that lead to negative growth? Justify with specific reason.

5. You have to create at least 15 logical & meaningful charts having important insights.


[ Hints : - Do the Vizualization in  a structured way while following "UBM" Rule.

U - Univariate Analysis,

B - Bivariate Analysis (Numerical - Categorical, Numerical - Numerical, Categorical - Categorical)

M - Multivariate Analysis
 ]





6. You may add more ml algorithms for model creation. Make sure for each and every algorithm, the following format should be answered.


*   Explain the ML Model used and it's performance using Evaluation metric Score Chart.


*   Cross- Validation & Hyperparameter Tuning

*   Have you seen any improvement? Note down the improvement with updates Evaluation metric Score Chart.

*   Explain each evaluation metric's indication towards business and the business impact pf the ML model used.

"""#### What all missing value imputation techniques have you used and why did you use those techniques?

Imputation Techniques: Choose an appropriate imputation strategy based on the data type and context. Common methods include mean, median, mode imputation, forward/backward fill, and predictive imputation.

The choice of techniques for handling missing values and performing imputation depends on several factors, including the nature of the data, the amount of missingness, the underlying distribution of the data, and the specific goals of the analysis or modeling. Here’s a breakdown of why each technique was suggested:

### 1. **Dropping Missing Values**
- **Why Use It**:
  - **Simplicity**: Dropping rows or columns with missing values is straightforward and can be effective when the amount of missing data is small.
  - **Preservation of Data Integrity**: If the missing values are random and constitute a small percentage of the dataset, dropping them may not significantly impact the overall analysis.
- **When to Use**:
  - When the dataset is large enough that losing a few rows or columns won't affect the analysis.
  - When the missing data is not systematic and is assumed to be missing completely at random (MCAR).

### 2. **Mean/Median/Mode Imputation**
- **Why Use It**:
  - **Simplicity and Speed**: These methods are easy to implement and computationally efficient.
  - **Preservation of Data Size**: Imputation allows you to retain all observations, which is particularly important in smaller datasets.
- **When to Use**:
  - Mean imputation is suitable for normally distributed numerical data.
  - Median imputation is better for skewed distributions, as it is less affected by outliers.
  - Mode imputation is appropriate for categorical variables where the most common category can reasonably replace missing values.

### 3. **Forward/Backward Fill**
- **Why Use It**:
  - **Temporal Data**: These methods are particularly useful for time series data, where the order of observations matters.
  - **Preservation of Trends**: Forward and backward filling can help maintain the trend in the data by carrying forward or backward the last observed value.
- **When to Use**:
  - When the data is sequential or time-based, and it is reasonable to assume that the last known value is a good estimate for the missing value.

### 4. **Predictive Imputation (e.g., KNN Imputer)**
- **Why Use It**:
  - **Data-Driven Approach**: Predictive imputation uses the relationships between features to estimate missing values, which can lead to more accurate imputations.
  - **Preservation of Data Distribution**: This method can help maintain the underlying distribution of the data better than simple imputation methods.
- **When to Use**:
  - When there is a significant amount of missing data, and the relationships between features can be leveraged to make informed estimates.
  - When the dataset is large enough to support the complexity of predictive modeling.

### Conclusion
The choice of technique for handling missing values should be guided by:
- The nature of the data (numerical vs. categorical, time series vs. static).
- The amount and pattern of missingness (random vs. systematic).
- The potential impact on the analysis or model performance.

By carefully selecting the appropriate technique, you can improve the quality of your dataset, reduce bias, and enhance the performance of your machine learning models. Each method has its strengths and weaknesses, and often a combination of techniques may be the best approach.

# Cap outliers
data['Overall Rating'] = np.where(data['Overall Rating'] > upper_bound, upper_bound, data['Overall Rating'])
data['Overall Rating'] = np.where(data['Overall Rating'] < lower_bound, lower_bound, data['Overall Rating'])

"""##### What all outlier treatment techniques have you used and why did you use those techniques?

### 1. **Removing Outliers**
- **Why Use It**:
  - **Error Correction**: Outliers may arise from data entry errors or measurement inaccuracies. Removing them can help ensure that the dataset reflects true observations.
  - **Improved Model Performance**: Outliers can disproportionately influence statistical analyses and machine learning models, leading to biased results. Removing them can lead to more robust models.
- **When to Use**:
  - When the outliers are clearly erroneous or not representative of the population being studied.
  - When the dataset is large enough that removing a few observations does not significantly impact the overall analysis.

### 2. **Transforming Outliers**
- **Why Use It**:
  - **Normalization**: Transformations (e.g., log transformation) can help reduce the skewness of the data and bring outliers closer to the main distribution, making the data more normally distributed.
  - **Mitigating Impact**: Transformations can lessen the influence of extreme values on statistical analyses and models without completely discarding the data.
- **When to Use**:
  - When the data contains positive values and is right-skewed, making log transformation appropriate.
  - When you want to retain the information from outliers but reduce their impact on the analysis.

### 3. **Capping or Flooring Outliers**
- **Why Use It**:
  - **Preservation of Data**: Capping or flooring allows you to retain all observations while limiting the influence of extreme values. This can be particularly useful in datasets where every observation is valuable.
  - **Maintaining Distribution**: This technique helps maintain the overall distribution of the data while addressing the influence of outliers.
- **When to Use**:
  - When you want to keep all data points but limit the effect of extreme values on your analysis or model.
  - When the outliers are valid observations but are extreme enough to skew results.

### 4. **Using Robust Statistical Methods**
- **Why Use It**:
  - **Resilience to Outliers**: Some statistical methods and machine learning algorithms (e.g., tree-based models) are inherently robust to outliers, meaning they can handle extreme values without significant degradation in performance.
  - **Avoiding Preprocessing**: By using robust methods, you can sometimes avoid the need for extensive outlier treatment, simplifying the preprocessing pipeline.
- **When to Use**:
  - When the dataset contains a significant number of outliers, and removing or transforming them would result in a loss of valuable information.
  - When you want to leverage the strengths of algorithms that are less sensitive to outliers.

### Summary
The choice of outlier treatment techniques depends on:
- **Nature of the Data**: Understanding whether the outliers are due to errors, natural variability, or novel phenomena is crucial.
- **Context of Analysis**: The goals of the analysis (e.g., exploratory data analysis vs. predictive modeling) can influence the choice of technique.
- **Impact on Results**: Evaluating how outliers affect the results and whether their removal or treatment leads to more accurate and reliable outcomes.

"""#### 2. Feature Selection

Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and random fluctuations, which leads to poor performance on unseen data. Feature selection plays a crucial role in preventing overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model and focusing on the most relevant information.

1. Start with a Baseline Model
Simple Model: Begin with a basic model using a small set of features that are likely to be relevant to the target variable.
Evaluate Performance: Assess the model's performance on a validation set or using cross-validation. This establishes a baseline for comparison.
2. Feature Importance
Model-Based Importance: If you're using a model that provides feature importance scores (e.g., tree-based models, linear models with regularization), use these scores to identify the most influential features.
Domain Expertise: Combine model-based importance with your understanding of the data to prioritize features that are both statistically significant and logically relevant to the problem.
3. Regularization
L1/L2 Regularization: Use regularization techniques like L1 (Lasso) or L2 (Ridge) to penalize large coefficients and encourage sparsity in the model. This helps to prevent overfitting by shrinking the influence of less important features.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Carefully tune the regularization strength using cross-validation to find the optimal balance between model complexity and generalization.
4. Feature Selection Techniques
Filter Methods: Use statistical measures (e.g., correlation, chi-squared test, mutual information) to rank features and select a subset based on a predefined threshold.
Wrapper Methods: Use a machine learning model as a black box to evaluate different feature subsets and select the one that yields the best performance. Examples include recursive feature elimination (RFE) and sequential feature selection (SFS).
Embedded Methods: Feature selection is integrated into the model training process, such as with L1 regularization or decision trees.
5. Cross-Validation
Multiple Folds: Use cross-validation with multiple folds to ensure that feature selection is not biased by a particular split of the data.
Nested Cross-Validation: For more robust feature selection, use nested cross-validation to select features within each fold of the outer cross-validation loop.

"""##### Which method have you used to scale you data and why?


Select Features: Choose the numerical features you want to scale. These are typically features with continuous values.
Create Scaler: Create an instance of StandardScaler.
Fit on Training Data: Fit the scaler only on the training data to avoid introducing bias from the test data.
Transform Data: Apply the scaler to both the training and testing data to transform the features to a standard scale (zero mean and unit variance).
Create DataFrame (Optional): Convert the scaled data back into DataFrames for easier handling and integration with your model training process.

Why StandardScaler?

StandardScaler is a common choice for data scaling because it:

Centers the data: By subtracting the mean, it centers the data around zero.
Scales the data: By dividing by the standard deviation, it ensures that the features have unit variance.
This helps prevent features with larger values from dominating the model and improves the performance of algorithms that are sensitive to feature scales.

Important Considerations:

Categorical Features: Do not scale categorical features that have been one-hot encoded, as it would distort their meaning.
Data Leakage: Always fit the scaler only on the training data and then apply it to the test data to avoid introducing bias.
Algorithm Choice: While scaling is beneficial for many algorithms, some algorithms, like tree-based models (e.g., decision trees, random forests), are less sensitive to feature scales. You might experiment with scaling and without scaling to see what works best for your specific model and dataset.

### 7. Dimesionality Reduction

##### Do you think that dimensionality reduction is needed? Explain Why?

Dimensionality reduction techniques can be useful for:

Reducing overfitting: By reducing the number of features, you can potentially improve the generalization ability of your model and prevent overfitting.
Improving model training speed: With fewer features, the model can train faster.
Visualization: Reducing the data to two or three dimensions can allow for visualization and exploration of the data.

Explanation:

Select Features: Choose the features you want to use for dimensionality reduction. These are typically the same features you scaled.
Create PCA Object: Create an instance of PCA and specify the number of principal components (n_components) you want to keep. This determines the dimensionality of the reduced data.
Fit on Training Data: Fit the PCA model only on the scaled training data to avoid data leakage.
Transform Data: Apply the PCA transformation to both the training and testing data to reduce the dimensionality.
Create DataFrames: Convert the transformed data back into DataFrames for easier handling.

"""##### Which dimensionality reduction technique have you used and why? (If dimensionality reduction done on dataset.)

PCA is a widely used dimensionality reduction technique because:

Linear Transformation: It finds the principal components, which are linear combinations of the original features, that capture the most variance in the data.
Variance Maximization: It aims to preserve as much information as possible in the reduced dimensions by maximizing the variance explained by the principal components.
Unsupervised: It doesn't require labeled data, making it suitable for exploratory data analysis.

# ... (rest of your code for model training and evaluation) ...

"""##### What data splitting ratio have you used and why?

Choosing a Wise Splitting Ratio

The choice of splitting ratio depends on several factors, including:

Dataset size: For smaller datasets, a larger testing set (e.g., 30% or even 40%) might be needed to get a reliable estimate of model performance. For larger datasets, a smaller testing set (e.g., 10% or 20%) might be sufficient.
Model complexity: More complex models are more prone to overfitting and may benefit from a larger training set.
Desired level of precision: If you need a very precise estimate of model performance, a larger testing set is generally preferred.
Common Splitting Ratios:

70/30: A common and generally well-balanced split.
80/20: Suitable for larger datasets where a smaller testing set is sufficient.
60/40 or 50/50: Can be used for smaller datasets or when a larger testing set is desired for more robust evaluation.

"""### 1. Which Evaluation metrics did you consider for a positive business impact and why?

Evaluation Metrics for Positive Business Impact:

The primary evaluation metrics considered for positive business impact in this project are:

Accuracy: Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions. A higher accuracy indicates that the model is more likely to predict whether a customer would recommend the airline correctly. This is crucial for understanding overall customer satisfaction and identifying areas for improvement.

Precision: Precision focuses on the proportion of correctly predicted positive recommendations (i.e., "yes") out of all the positive predictions made by the model. High precision ensures that when the model predicts a customer would recommend the airline, it's highly likely to be true. This helps in targeting marketing efforts and focusing on customers who are more likely to have a positive experience.

Recall: Recall measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive recommendations out of all the actual positive recommendations in the dataset. High recall means the model is effectively identifying a large percentage of customers who would recommend the airline. This is important for understanding the true reach of positive customer sentiment and identifying potential brand advocates.

F1-score: The F1-score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure that considers both aspects. It's particularly useful when there's an imbalance between positive and negative recommendations in the dataset. A high F1-score indicates a good balance between identifying positive recommendations accurately (precision) and capturing a large proportion of them (recall).

Why these metrics were chosen:

These metrics were chosen for their relevance to positive business impact in the following ways:

Customer Satisfaction: Accuracy and F1-score provide a holistic view of the model's ability to predict customer recommendations, reflecting overall customer satisfaction.

Targeted Marketing: High precision helps identify customers who are more likely to have a positive experience, enabling targeted marketing efforts and resource allocation.

Brand Advocacy: High recall helps identify potential brand advocates and understand the true reach of positive customer sentiment, which is valuable for brand building and reputation management.

Balanced Performance: The F1-score balances precision and recall, ensuring the model performs well in both aspects, which is crucial for making informed business decisions.

By focusing on these evaluation metrics, businesses can gain valuable insights into customer satisfaction, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to enhance the customer experience and drive positive business outcomes.

### 2. Which ML model did you choose from the above created models as your final prediction model and why?

the selection of the final prediction model from the three models created (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) and the rationale behind the choice.

Final Prediction Model:

Based on the evaluation metrics and overall performance, the Random Forest model is chosen as the final prediction model for this project.

Reasons for Choosing Random Forest:

Higher Accuracy: The Random Forest model consistently achieved the highest accuracy scores compared to Logistic Regression and Decision Tree, indicating its superior ability to predict customer recommendations correctly.

Improved Precision and Recall: Random Forest also demonstrated better precision and recall scores, suggesting a good balance between identifying positive recommendations accurately and capturing a large proportion of them.

Robustness: Random Forest is known for its robustness to overfitting and handling noisy data, making it a more reliable choice for real-world scenarios.

Feature Importance: Random Forest provides insights into feature importance, which can help understand the factors that most influence customer recommendations. This information is valuable for making targeted improvements to the airline's services.

Hyperparameter Tuning: The performance of Random Forest can be further enhanced through hyperparameter tuning, as demonstrated by the improvement in evaluation metrics after using GridSearchCV.

Ensemble Method: Random Forest is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees, leveraging the wisdom of the crowd to make more accurate and robust predictions.

Comparison with Other Models:

Logistic Regression: While Logistic Regression is a simple and interpretable model, it might not capture complex relationships in the data as effectively as Random Forest.

Decision Tree: Decision Trees are prone to overfitting and can be sensitive to small changes in the data. Random Forest overcomes these limitations by combining multiple trees and using random feature subsets.

Conclusion:

Considering the superior performance, robustness, and valuable insights provided by Random Forest, it is the most suitable model for predicting customer recommendations in this project. It offers a higher level of accuracy and reliability compared to the other models, making it the preferred choice for driving positive business impact.

### 3. Explain the model which you have used and the feature importance using any model explainability tool?

the Random Forest model and its feature importance using the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) model explainability tool.

Explaining the Random Forest Model:

The Random Forest model is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. Each decision tree in the forest is trained on a random subset of the data and features, introducing diversity and robustness. The final prediction is made by averaging the predictions of all individual trees. This approach helps to reduce overfitting and improve the model's generalization ability.
