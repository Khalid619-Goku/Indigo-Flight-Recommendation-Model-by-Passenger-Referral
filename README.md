# Indigo-Flight-Recommendation-Model-by-Passenger-Referral
It is a classification based model (Porject) under AlmaBetter Full Stack Data Science Program.

This project focuses on building a machine learning classification model to predict whether a passenger will book a flight, based on referral information and other relevant features. The goal is to help airlines and travel platforms better understand how referrals influence booking behavior, enabling more targeted marketing and referral strategies.

🚀 Project Overview
Referral programs are a powerful tool in customer acquisition. This model uses historical passenger data—including referral status, demographics, and travel behavior—to classify the likelihood of a flight booking. It can be integrated into marketing systems to optimize referral campaigns and improve conversion rates.

🧠 Model Features
Referral Status: Whether a passenger was referred or not.

Referral Source: The channel or person through which the referral was made.

Passenger Demographics: Age, gender, occupation, etc.

Travel History: Number of past bookings, destinations, travel frequency.

Booking Details: Travel dates, class of travel, etc.

🛠️ Tech Stack
